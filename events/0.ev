You, Graham Northup, have succesfully stolen Melania Trump's Solid Gold Toilet. Unfortunately, the toilet was TRAPPED! Upon taking your first dump, you were transported 70 million years in the past, and the Trump dinosaurs have been sent to kill you and bury the toilet in a secure location to be dug up in the future. 
The only way to escape is to hack the toilet's time trap and take one final dump to send you back into the future. Unfortunately, your laptop is nowhere to be found, and you hear footsteps approaching from the trees.
EVENTS:
1 - Run and carry the toilet away - - M CAF
2 - Ask who is it - - 
3 - Stay absolutely still - Caf < 10 -
